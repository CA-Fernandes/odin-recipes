        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its comforting layers of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and gooey melted cheese. To start, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Meanwhile, prepare the meat sauce by sautéing finely chopped onions and garlic in olive oil until translucent. Add ground beef or a combination of beef and pork, cooking until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, basil, and a pinch of sugar for balance. Simmer the sauce to allow the flavors to meld. In a separate pan, create a velvety béchamel sauce by melting butter, whisking in flour, and gradually adding warm milk until thickened. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
            
            Now, it's time to assemble the lasagna. In a deep baking dish, start with a layer of the meat sauce, followed by a layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Spread a portion of béchamel over the noodles and sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat these layers until you reach the top of the dish, finishing with a final layer of cheese. Bake the lasagna in the oven until golden and bubbly. Allow it to rest for a few minutes before slicing into the decadent layers of pasta, sauce, and cheese. Serve this hearty and flavorful lasagna with a side of garlic bread and a fresh salad for a satisfying and wholesome meal that's sure to please everyone at the table.
